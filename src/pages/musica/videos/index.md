Blaž and I took our first record at **Mišo Limić's** studio. We experienced such a good atmosphere. Every detail is designed professionally. The studio is not too big- three small rooms. Can you imagine that the concert piano is in the smallest room?  Big Croatian artists were recorded in this place such as Zorica Kondža. For us, it was respectability to play in this place. Big people stay big. Forever.
