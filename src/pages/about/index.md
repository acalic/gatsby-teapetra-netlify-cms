## Hey you! My name is **Petra, Tea Petra**. Yes, two names but not two characters. My soulmates are violin, camera and my time. Ou, and, yes. To mention- Going to restoranut? Joging? Even surfing on internet? Let's plan it 'cause time management is weapon to make art better.

**ADORING :** dancing, walking and reading books. There are rare moments when I decide to spent on Netflix.

**PETS:** Still do not have pets but I am dog person even Jordan Peterson suggested me to touch every cat on the street. 

Yes, I'm friendly but I need ''Tea's time'' every day. In 30 minutes I can recharge my bateries. I'm the lucky one 'couse I live in Dalmatia so I can implement holistic lifestyle. 

##### My virutes are nobility (help and give) and mgnificence. So, if I'm not an artist I would be the doctor.
