## Hey you! My name is **Petra, Tea Petra**. Yes, two names but not two characters. My soulmates are violin, camera and my time. Ou, and, yes. To mention - Going to restaurant? Jogging? Even surfing on the internet? Let's plan it 'cause time management is weapon to make art better.

**ADORING:** dancing, walking, reading, writing, posing, playing, being argumentative, idealizing, brainstorming, analyzing, loving, kissing, exploring, listening, eating, bathing etc. Sometimes I watch TV and Netflix.

**PETS:  100%** dog person even Jordan Peterson suggested me to touch every cat on the street.

Yes, I'm friendly but I need ''Tea's time'' every day. In 30 minutes I can recharge my batteries. I'm the lucky one 'cause I live in Dalmatia so I can implement a holistic lifestyle.

##### My virtues are nobility (help and give) and magnificence. So, if I'm not an artist I would be the doctor.
