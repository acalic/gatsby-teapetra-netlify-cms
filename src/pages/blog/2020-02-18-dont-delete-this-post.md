NADINE & NEIL

![](/img/_MG_1874.jpg)

#### **NADINE:**     strong, nervous, funny, obvious

#### **NEIL:**            gentelman, warm, clever, spotless





**I FELT IN LOVEEE WITH SMALL WEDDINGS (ELOPEMENT).**

I opened the main door and entered inside. Me, in front of the ten chairs and empty space. First thought came up to my mind: ''Is this wedding or...?'' I used to see huge weddings that count 150 guests. But, then I unwind the conversation with the manager and little word he mentioned: **ELOPEMENT.** I knew that will be my niche MOMENTARILY.  Why? I like to challenge myself and be who I am. I am everything that elopement is:

* SOPHISTICATED
* ZESTFUL
* RICH INSIDE
* TENDENCY

Lucky my, now I have **my sweet spot.** 

**and..**

The atmosphere was smooth with guests in the relaxed. No wind, no heat. I was smiling, gently. I didn't try to organize my steps. I notice some places, decide to be spontaneous, and put the couple's spirit to make the rest. That was THE formula that I will definitely implement in my future job.
